Four of the agents provided the value 32 (reflecting Zachary's 35 push-ups minus 3 crunches), while one agent provided the outlier value of 1. The weighted average is therefore (1 + 32 + 32 + 32 + 32) / 5 = 25.8. The level of agreement is high among the four agents, but the one deviation from crew_1 notably reduced the overall average.

Although crew_5 provided an incomplete response, the weighted average, assuming equal weight for complete answers, confirms that Paco ate 14 more salty cookies than sweet cookies."
          },
          "explanation": "The weighted_average method was applied by treating each complete and coherent numerical response with equal weight. With four responses agreeing on 14, the computed weighted average is 14, and the high level of inter-agent consensus (crew_1, crew_2, crew_3, and crew_4) reinforces the final answer. The only discrepancy is the incomplete response from crew_5, which did not affect the overall consensus. Final confidence level is high."

          "explanation": "We computed the weighted average by aggregating identical results from crew_2, crew_5, crew_1, and crew_3, all arriving at 49 chairs.

          },
          "explanation": "The majority vote was achieved by crew_2, crew_3, crew_4, and crew_5, who all calculated the cost by dividing the $4 total by 2 candy bars, arriving at $2 each. Crew_1 provided a similar step-by-step approach. While there was a minor discussion regarding an inconsistency in the problem's narrative, the final agreed answer is based on the arithmetic, resulting in a high confidence level for the $2 answer."

          },
          "explanation": "The weighted_average method was applied to integrate five agent responses. Even though the responses included additional commentary about an inconsistency regarding the available funds, every agent computed the cost per candy bar as $4 divided by 2, resulting in $2. The weighted resolution treats the numeric output as the key value (with a default weight of 1 for each agent), leading to a high level of agreement among crew_1, crew_2, crew_3, crew_4, and crew_5. Thus, the aggregated final answer is that each candy bar costs $2."

Applying the weighted average aggregation with equal weights (default weight 1 for each agent) results in (27+27+27+27+27)/5 = 27. There is a high level of agreement among the agents, supporting a high final confidence level."
