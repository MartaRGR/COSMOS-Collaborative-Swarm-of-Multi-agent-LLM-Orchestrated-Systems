        "explanation": "Three of the five agents (crew_5, crew_4, and crew_3) reached a consistent solution by expressing the numbers in the desired range as 100k + 13 and determining that k runs from 3247 to 4365, which gives a total count of 4365 \u2212 3247 + 1 = 1119. Two agents (crew_1 and crew_2) arrived at different answers likely due to misinterpretations of the number formatting and range, but the consensus among the majority supports 1119 as the correct count. Thus, the final unified answer is 1119 (option D) with a high level of confidence."
