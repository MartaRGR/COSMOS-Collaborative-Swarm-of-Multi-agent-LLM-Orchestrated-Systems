Adding the 13 students who can do neither, the total number of students is 25 + 13 = 38. The other agents returned error codes (429 and 504), so the final aggregated answer relies solely on crew_5's response. The level of agreement is low since only one agent provided a valid answer, but given the clear and correct reasoning, our final aggregated answer is 38 (option C), with medium confidence."

With the majority vote method applied, the valid answer from crew_5 is accepted as the final answer. Although the level of inter-agent agreement was low due to the errors, the available consistent solution indicates that the correct answer is 38 (option C). Agents: crew_5 (valid answer) versus crew_1, crew_2, crew_3, and crew_4 (error responses). The overall consensus, given the available data, supports a final confidence level of medium."

        "explanation": "Only one of the agent crews (crew_5) provided a successful calculation, determining that the total number of students is 38. The other agents returned error codes (429 and 504), so their responses could not contribute any numeric data. By applying the weighted_average method to the available result, we exclusively used crew_5's correct deduction, resulting in a final answer of 38 (with the provided final choice of C). The overall agreement is low among the agents due to most not returning a valid response; however, the single available valid response gives us a medium-high confidence in this outcome. Agents involved: crew_5 (used for numerical answer), while crew_1, crew_2, crew_3, and crew_4 provided error responses."
