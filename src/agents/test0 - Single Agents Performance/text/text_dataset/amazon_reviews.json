Okay so I tried anonther one the same thing. I ran through at least 3 boxes before I got it to work, and my cd burner wasnt bad either I tried all of them in differnt cd burner drives nothing. This product is garbage.",

    "input_text": "When ordering a dvd from an English-language site, it would be reasonable to assume that it would contain English language dialogue or at the very least, subtitles in English especially when one knows that an English language version of the title is available. It mystifies me why a product with neither attribute is offered for sale in Amazon US or UK when there are Amazon sites specifically tailored to process products in foreign languages. At the very least, such dvds should have a notice right at the the top of the product entry informing us that it is not an English-language version or the title should be displayed in a foreign language. For me, ordering this useless article was a complete waste of time.",

I finished all these books within 2 days. These are the first books the author wrote that I read and it is sad to see so wonderful a book end. Keep it up and I will continue to buy more of your books. Thanks for these beautiful books.",

Mine is the 2003 V3.0 version and it does finally include \"internet\" -- but don't bother looking for \"blog\" as it is not there. Could the etymologies and histories be more complete? Yes. Other criticisms I read of this CD are also on the mark, as, for example, the absence of many of the print-version illustrations.There are a lot of search options that could be helpful. One of these claims to find homophones (homonyms). This version will find neither \"bow\" for \"bough\" nor \"ruff\" for \"rough\".Still a useful item for many purposes, but complete or unabridged it's not.",
