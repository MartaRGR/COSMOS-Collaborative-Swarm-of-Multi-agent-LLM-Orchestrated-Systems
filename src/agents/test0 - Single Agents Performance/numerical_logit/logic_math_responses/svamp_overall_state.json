Since the shelf then had 6 action figures, the calculation 7 - 6 = 1 applies. Each detailed response (from crew_2, crew_3, crew_4, and crew_5) aligns on this reasoning."

          "explanation": "The synthesis was based on the consensus among the provided responses, where a clear majority showed the step-by-step process leading to the conclusion that 1 action figure was removed. The common reasoning infers that after adding 4 to the original 3, resulting in 7, removing figures to leave 6 means exactly 1 was removed.

Crew_4 used a similar approach with additional notation, confirming that 1 figure was removed. Thus, with all agents in agreement on the final result, the aggregated answer is based on the consensus among the responses.

            "details": "Interpreting the phrase '5 sets of tables, each set has 10 chairs' as meaning that there are 5 tables (one table per set) and 50 chairs in total (5 sets × 10 chairs), the computed difference is 50 - 5 = 45. While one crew (crew_5) mistakenly computed the number of tables as 50, the strongest, most detailed reasoning (from crew_3) supports the interpretation that each set includes one table. Thus, there are 45 more chairs than tables."
          },
          "explanation": "The aggregated responses were synthesized using llm_synthesis. Crew_3 provided a clear calculation yielding a 45-chair difference, while crew_5’s response contained a misinterpretation leading to a result of 0. The other crews did not complete their solutions. Given the consensus and clarity from crew_3, and a common interpretation of the wording, the final answer is 45. The overall agreement is medium-high among agents, with significant discrepancy only in crew_5's misinterpretation. The final confidence level is high."

          "explanation": "Using the majority_vote method, we compared the agents' responses. Crew_3 provided a complete and logical calculation resulting in 45, while Crew_5's complete answer concluded with 0 by misinterpreting the term 'set.' The other agents provided incomplete answers. Given the typical interpretation of a dining set (one table and associated chairs), the consensus supports the answer of 45 more chairs than tables. This result reflects moderate agreement among the agents (with significant disagreement only between Crew_3 and Crew_5), leading to a final confidence level of medium.

Crew crew_3 arrived at a difference of 45 (assuming 5 tables and 50 chairs), while crew crew_5 concluded that there is no difference (0) by interpreting the sets differently. Using the weighted_average method with equal default weights, we compute (45 + 0) / 2 = 22.5. The remaining responses were incomplete. Therefore, the aggregated answer is that there are 22.5 more chairs than tables."

The level of agreement is high, leading to a final confidence level that is high."

Applying the weighted average aggregation with equal weights (default weight 1 for each agent) results in (27+27+27+27+27)/5 = 27. There is a high level of agreement among the agents, supporting a high final confidence level."
