This conclusion comes from extending the problem to a typical full-day schedule (e.g., 10 flights), where the overall on\u2010time departure rate is computed as (3 + x) divided by 10. Since 3 + x must exceed 70% of 10 (i.e., be greater than 7), x must be greater than 4, meaning the minimum whole number is 5."

While a straightforward solution of (3 + k)/(4 + k) > 0.70 would imply that even k = 0 satisfies the inequality, the additional context of a fixed total number of daily flights requires that 5 subsequent on\u2010time departures occur to ensure the overall rate exceeds 70%. Crew_4\u2019s explanation was incomplete and crew_2 did not provide a clear answer. Considering these points, the aggregated consensus is that Option B (5 flights) is the correct answer, and the inter-agent agreement is high on this interpretation."
