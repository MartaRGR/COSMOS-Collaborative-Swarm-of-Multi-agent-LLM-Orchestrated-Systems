The next number that ends in 13 is 324,713.\n   \n2. **Upper limit**:\n   - The upper limit is 436,600. The largest number less than or equal to this that ends in 13 is 436,613.\n\n### Step 2: List relevant numbers\n\nNow, we will list the integers from 324,713 to 436,613 that end in ...13.\n\n- The numbers would be: 324,713, 324,813, 324,913, ..., 435,913, 436,013, 436,113.\n\n### Step 3: General Formulation\n\nThe numbers that end in 13 can be represented in a general form:\n- \\( n = x,013 \\) or \\( n = x,113 \\), where \\( x \\) is some integer value.\n\n### Step 4: Identify valid ranges of \\( x \\)\n\nTo determine the valid values of \\( x \\):\n\n1. **For the minimum**:\n   - Starting from 324,700, we found 324,713 as the first valid number. \n\n2. **For the maximum**:\n   - The last valid number within our given range is 436,613.\n\nThis means we can express \\( n \\) in the form of:\n- From 324,713 to 436,613\n\nTo represent \\( x \\):\n- 324,713 corresponds to \\( x = 324 \\)\n- 436,613 corresponds to \\( x = 436 \\)\n\n### Step 5: Counting the integers\n\nNow we note that each increment of ten gives us another valid number ending in \"13\":\n\n- The numbers follow the sequence:\n  - 324,713, 324,813, 324,913, ..., up to 436,613.\n\nThus, we need:\n- Start at \\( x = 324 \\) and end at \\( x = 436 \\):\n  - That includes all integers from 324 to 436.\n\n### Step 6: Count the integers in range\n\nCounting from 324 to 436:\n\\[ 436 - 324 + 1 = 113 \\]\nThis gives us the total count of valid numbers.\n\n### Step 7: Total count of valid numbers is\n\nThe total numbers between the limits with last two digits as \"13\" is:\n\n- From 324 to 436 gives 113 numbers.\n\nAnd there are 10 possible values of x for each full increment (one for each decade)\n\nHowever, let\u2019s calculate:\n- If we sweep from 324 through 436 directly we realize we are in a consistent incrementation without any skipped values through 1 unit per step.\n\nFinally, we compile all valid tens and units:\n- Thus it translates the total integers to match that run which results from our original setup:\n- Thus leading to the choice from mentioned options - analyzing closely gives a conglomerate of around 327.\n\n<<< FINAL ANSWER: A >>>",

Specifically, we need to look for numbers that end in 13 (where the tens digit is 1) since the last two digits we are considering are 13.\n\n1. **Setting up the range:**\n   - The numbers must be in the range from 324,700 to 436,600.\n   - The relevant integers we are looking for need to be formatted as follows: **xx13**.\n\n2. **Identify the first integer in the range ending with 13:**\n   - The lowest number greater than or equal to 324,700 that ends with 13 is 324,713.\n\n3. **Identify the last integer in the range ending with 13:**\n   - The highest number less than or equal to 436,600 that ends with 13 is 436,613.\n\n4. **Formulating the sequence:**\n   - The integers of interest therefore form a sequence that starts at 324,713 and ends at 436,613 and all have the form of **xxx13**.\n   - The numbers of this form are represented as 13 added to multiples of 100, starting from 324,700.\n\n5. **Finding the progression:**\n   - The first term is: \\( 324,713 = 324700 + 13 \\)\n   - The last term is: \\( 436,613 = 436600 + 13 \\)\n   - The general term can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     a_n = 324713 + (n-1) \\times 100\n     \\]\n   - We need to find \\( n \\) such that \\( a_n \\leq 436613 \\).\n\n6. **Setting up the inequality:**\n   \\[\n   324713 + (n-1) \\times 100 \\leq 436613\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   (n-1) \\times 100 \\leq 436613 - 324713\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   (n-1) \\times 100 \\leq 111900\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   n-1 \\leq 1119 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad n \\leq 1120\n   \\]\n\n7. **Calculate the number of integers:**\n   - The sequence starts from \\( n = 1 \\) (for \\( 324713 \\)).\n   - Therefore, valid integers range from \\( n = 1 \\) to 1120, which indicates \\( n = 1120 \\) integers.\n\nThus, the total count of integers between 324,700 and 436,600 that have a tens digit of 1 and a units digit of 3 is **1119**.\n\nBased on the options provided:\n\n<<< FINAL ANSWER: D >>>",

The next number that ends in 13 is 324,713.\n   \n2. **Upper limit**:\n   - The upper limit is 436,600. The largest number less than or equal to this that ends in 13 is 436,613.\n\n### Step 2: List relevant numbers\n\nNow, we will list the integers from 324,713 to 436,613 that end in ...13.\n\n- The numbers would be: 324,713, 324,813, 324,913, ..., 435,913, 436,013, 436,113.\n\n### Step 3: General Formulation\n\nThe numbers that end in 13 can be represented in a general form:\n- \\( n = x,013 \\) or \\( n = x,113 \\), where \\( x \\) is some integer value.\n\n### Step 4: Identify valid ranges of \\( x \\)\n\nTo determine the valid values of \\( x \\):\n\n1. **For the minimum**:\n   - Starting from 324,700, we found 324,713 as the first valid number. \n\n2. **For the maximum**:\n   - The last valid number within our given range is 436,613.\n\nThis means we can express \\( n \\) in the form of:\n- From 324,713 to 436,613\n\nTo represent \\( x \\):\n- 324,713 corresponds to \\( x = 324 \\)\n- 436,613 corresponds to \\( x = 436 \\)\n\n### Step 5: Counting the integers\n\nNow we note that each increment of ten gives us another valid number ending in \"13\":\n\n- The numbers follow the sequence:\n  - 324,713, 324,813, 324,913, ..., up to 436,613.\n\nThus, we need:\n- Start at \\( x = 324 \\) and end at \\( x = 436 \\):\n  - That includes all integers from 324 to 436.\n\n### Step 6: Count the integers in range\n\nCounting from 324 to 436:\n\\[ 436 - 324 + 1 = 113 \\]\nThis gives us the total count of valid numbers.\n\n### Step 7: Total count of valid numbers is\n\nThe total numbers between the limits with last two digits as \"13\" is:\n\n- From 324 to 436 gives 113 numbers.\n\nAnd there are 10 possible values of x for each full increment (one for each decade)\n\nHowever, let\u2019s calculate:\n- If we sweep from 324 through 436 directly we realize we are in a consistent incrementation without any skipped values through 1 unit per step.\n\nFinally, we compile all valid tens and units:\n- Thus it translates the total integers to match that run which results from our original setup:\n- Thus leading to the choice from mentioned options - analyzing closely gives a conglomerate of around 327.\n\n<<< FINAL ANSWER: A >>>",

Specifically, we need to look for numbers that end in 13 (where the tens digit is 1) since the last two digits we are considering are 13.\n\n1. **Setting up the range:**\n   - The numbers must be in the range from 324,700 to 436,600.\n   - The relevant integers we are looking for need to be formatted as follows: **xx13**.\n\n2. **Identify the first integer in the range ending with 13:**\n   - The lowest number greater than or equal to 324,700 that ends with 13 is 324,713.\n\n3. **Identify the last integer in the range ending with 13:**\n   - The highest number less than or equal to 436,600 that ends with 13 is 436,613.\n\n4. **Formulating the sequence:**\n   - The integers of interest therefore form a sequence that starts at 324,713 and ends at 436,613 and all have the form of **xxx13**.\n   - The numbers of this form are represented as 13 added to multiples of 100, starting from 324,700.\n\n5. **Finding the progression:**\n   - The first term is: \\( 324,713 = 324700 + 13 \\)\n   - The last term is: \\( 436,613 = 436600 + 13 \\)\n   - The general term can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     a_n = 324713 + (n-1) \\times 100\n     \\]\n   - We need to find \\( n \\) such that \\( a_n \\leq 436613 \\).\n\n6. **Setting up the inequality:**\n   \\[\n   324713 + (n-1) \\times 100 \\leq 436613\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   (n-1) \\times 100 \\leq 436613 - 324713\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   (n-1) \\times 100 \\leq 111900\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   n-1 \\leq 1119 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad n \\leq 1120\n   \\]\n\n7. **Calculate the number of integers:**\n   - The sequence starts from \\( n = 1 \\) (for \\( 324713 \\)).\n   - Therefore, valid integers range from \\( n = 1 \\) to 1120, which indicates \\( n = 1120 \\) integers.\n\nThus, the total count of integers between 324,700 and 436,600 that have a tens digit of 1 and a units digit of 3 is **1119**.\n\nBased on the options provided:\n\n<<< FINAL ANSWER: D >>>",

Crew_3\u2019s response of 113 appears to be a misinterpretation of the sequence. Crews 4 and 1 returned error codes and thus were omitted.
