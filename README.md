# COSMOS Framework

COSMOS is a modular framework designed to integrate and evaluate Multi-agent Systems with Swarm Intelligence. This project is part of a research effort for a scientific paper and a doctoral thesis.

## Abstract

COSMOS is a comprehensive framework that integrates Multi-agent Systems and Swarm Intelligence to tackle complex tasks in machine learning. By combining these two paradigms, COSMOS aims to enhance the performance and adaptability of models across various applications. The framework supports a range of tasks such as occupancy forecasting, object recognition, and depth analysis, showcasing its potential for real-world scenarios.
Besides, COSMOS incorporates swarm intelligence techniques and answer aggregation methods to optimize decision-making processes in multi-agent environments and improve traceability and interpretability of results.
The framework emphasizes flexibility and scalability, allowing researchers to customize hyperparameters, preprocess data dynamically, and incorporate new models with minimal effort. Its predictive capabilities are demonstrated through applications  COSMOS is designed to support reproducible research, making it a valuable tool for advancing the state of the art in machine learning and its applications.
